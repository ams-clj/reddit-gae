# reddit-gae

An in-fieri Reddit clone written in Clojure that runs on Google AppEngine

## Usage

To run reddit-gae in GAE dev server you need to:
$ lein deps && lein compile
$ dev_appserver.sh war/

Assuming you already have appengine in your path.

If you want a really nice interactive development you will need:
$ lein swank
M-x slime-connect
C-c C-k in redditongae.core
in slime repl:
(require 'local-dev)
(local-dev/init-app-engine)
(local-dev/start-server (var example))
